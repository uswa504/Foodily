	"<h3>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1876 - 1948)</h3><p><blockquote>“Hard times don't create heroes. It is during the hard times when the 'hero' within us is revealed.”</blockquote>The bright star of the history of Pakistan is Mohammad Ali Jinnah. It was the will of Allah that a physically weakling son of Poonjah Jinnah would one day be the founder of Pakistan. Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on 25th December 1876. He got his early education at “Sindh Madrassat-ul-Islam” and the “Christian Mission School”. After his matriculation, he was sent to England for higher studies in 1893. He distinguished himself over there as a keen and upright student. He joined the Lincoln’s Inn and graduated as a brilliant Barrister in 1896. While still in London, he also started to participate in politics. Gradually Jinnah was developing his own political outlook. Three years later, he became Bombay’s most famous lawyer.<br>He formally entered in politics in 1905 from the platform of Indian National Congress. He was an ardent supporter of Hindu-Muslim unity.  But when he realized that the congress was a neo-Hindu body and stood for Ram Raj, he resigned and joined the All India Muslim League in 1922.<br>He inspired the Muslims of India with his glorious vision. He worked hard for a separate homeland for the Muslims. The odds were against him. The Hindus and British were hostile to him. But he grappled with every problem. His aim was high. He soared like an eagle. He translated two nations theory and Iqbal’s dream into Reality. He said:<br><blockquote>“We believe in one God, They believe in many Gods. We don't have cast system, they have cast system. We can't be interned nor interline. How can we live together?”</blockquote>To get Muslim people freedom, Quaid-e-Azam played a big role. August 14, 1947 was the day of his triumph. Pakistan appeared on the map of World. He took oath of office as the first Governor General of the new country. Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the Quaid-e-Azam in a true sense of the word. His health had been breaking down under a heavy pressure of work. His last message was:<br><blockquote>“The foundations of your state have been laid and it is now for you to build as quickly and as well as you can.”</blockquote>He died in Karachi on September 11th, 1948. But founders and heroes like him never die.<br><blockquote>“Gandhi died by the hands of an assassin; Jinnah died by his devotion to Pakistan.”</blockquote></p>";

	"<h3>Allama Muhammad Iqbal (1877 - 1938)</h3><blockquote>“Nations are born in the hearts of poets, they prosper and die in the hands of Politicians.”</blockquote>To me, a hero is a person who has a goal to bring a positive change in the area which he targets. Allama Muhammad Iqbal is the person to be called as a hero. He was born in Sialkot on November 9, 1877. He belonged to a Kashmiri Family, which had embraced Islam.

At the same time, he wrote many famous poems. His poems carry the message of Islam. People even bestowed him the title of “Shair-e-Mashriq”. The central theme and main source of his message was the Holy Quran. Through his poetry, he urged the Muslims to rekindle the flame of faith in their hearts.<blockquote>“To have no faith is worse than slavery.”</blockquote>The themes of his poetry were of great importance and still they are regarded as a great source of inspiration. Through his poetry, He gave the message of “Khudi”.  His concept of self-realization is not merely based on Divine power, rather he highlighted that in order for us to seek the truth of our existence; proper training, experiences and education plays a vital role. His philosophies promoted the social norms and values and in order to progress social interaction is very much important. He once said:<blockquote>“Individual exists by virtue of his social contacts. He is nonentity without that association. He is like a wave in the river and has no existence outside it.”</blockquote>The most famous poetic works of Iqbal are: Shikwa Jawab-e-Shikwa, Armaghan-e-Hijaz, Javed Nama, Baal-e-Jibrael, Zarb-e-Kaleem, Musafir, Javed Nama, Ramuz-e-Bekhudi, Bange-Dira etc.<br>It was he, who gave the idea of a separate homeland for Indian Muslims. Quaid-e-Azam respected him and honored his opinions. If the Muslims begin to study, understand and follow his advices, they will surpass the nation and get an elevated place in this World. He is surely a hero in a true sense.<br>He could not live long to see Pakistan and died in 1938. He was buried in Lahore near Badshahi Masjid. He is known throughout the World as “The poet of the East”, “The sage of Ummah” and “Thinker of Pakistan”.<blockquote>“The ultimate goal of the go is not to see something but to be something.”</blockquote>";
